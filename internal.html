    <h1>why ayyappa has 18 steps?</h1>
    <p>18 steps – part of the ritual
        Lord Ayyappa devotees who visit the Sabarimala shrine have to climb up 18 steps to the sanctum sanctorum, all
        the while chanting the Pathinettam padi (song of the 18 steps).<br>

        The climb has rules: Every devotee must begin it with their right foot. Only those who have undertaken the
        41-day penance — which involves abstinence from all worldly pleasures — are allowed to ascend the 18 steps.<br>

        On their way to the temple, Ayyappa devotees must carry the ‘irumudi’, a small black cloth bundle that consists
        of puja items or personal possessions like a change of clothes and something to eat like dry fruits, on their
        head.<br><br>
        Religious significance<br>
        The 18 steps have considerable religious significance. Devotees believe that ascending these steps helps detach
        them from worldly desires, mentally and physically.<br>

        The first five steps are called panchedriyas: They symbolise the five human senses of sight, sound, smell, taste
        and touch.<br>

        Next come the eight steps of the ashtaragas. These signify emotions: Krodh (anger), kama (love), lobh (greed),
        moh (lust), asooya (jealousy), dhoombh (boastfulness), madha (unhealthy competition) and maltsarya (pride). It
        is believed that climbing up the steps while chanting helps control emotions that cause pain in the world.<br>

        The trigunas, the next three steps, stand for three human qualities, satva (goodness or purity), rajas (passion)
        and tamas (inertia or dullness).
        The last two steps represent vidya (knowledge) and its opposite, avidya (ignorance).<br>

        The steps were originally of granite, but later covered with panchaloha, a special mixture of gold, silver,
        copper, iron and tin.<br>

        The steps are believed to be special for other reasons too. For one, Ayyappa was a master of 18 weapons — each
        step is dedicated to each of those weapons, which Ayyappa is believed to have finally surrendered at the
        “pathinettam padi” or the eighteenth step.<br>

        Some also believe that the steps represent the 18 hills around Sabarimala, of which the highest is the one the
        temple stands on.</p>
