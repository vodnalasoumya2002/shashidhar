    <h3> “Resolute” by Saeda Rose</h3><br><br>
    <p>Exercise More!Buy the shoes. It’s okay, screw the budget, that’s not this year’s resolution. You deserve this.
      When the
      saleswoman asks you if you’ve done much running, laugh and gesture to your mid-section. The woman will blink,
      force
      out a half-baked hah. It’s a reaction of discomfort, not cruelty; you made it weird. You don’t know why you feel
      the
      need to shame your own body in front of a stranger, but you blame it on her lululemon leggings and air-hostess
      smile. She makes you nervous. Most people...</p><br>

    <h3>“Involuntary Recipient” by V. S. Rose</h3><br><br>
    <p>Drip. Drip. Drip.I don’t know how long it’s been. My hankering for water and parched lips suggest more than a few
      hours. The screams from my ravenous stomach say longer than a couple of days. Weeks maybe? Would I have survived
      weeks?Drip. Drip.What’s that dripping sound?My head feels like it was squeezed in a table clamp. I can’t tell if
      my thinking’s foggy from my throbbing head or the lack of food and water. This pitch darkness sure doesn’t help.

    <h3>“Blood and Cookies ” by Daniel Allen</h3><br><br>
    <p>TW: Contains some descriptions of blood and violencePhilip smiled at me as I shuffled towards his counter.
      ‘Morning Frank, how can
      I help you?’Good. If Philip was in a cheerful mood, that would make this much easier. I smiled back at him. ‘One
      course of antibiotics, please.’He eyed me with concern. ‘You’re sick?’‘No,’ I replied. ‘Katy is. She’s got crimson
      fever.’Philip’s eyes widened. ‘I’ll get your meds right away.’ He put on his spectacles and turned to rifle
      through the bottles an...</p><br>

    <h3>“The Guest House” by Willa Wheeler</h3><br><br>
    <p>Carson Liao was the richest man in the world, so of course he was always being watched. Reporters were on him
      like flies on shit the second he stepped out in public. He had bodyguards, bulletproof windows on his limousines,
      and a security system so high-tech that anyone who breathed in the direction of his front gate got flagged. But
      this. This was different. This was a nagging feeling, a prickle at the back of his neck. It made him constantly
      want to glance over his shoulder. He felt it when he was in the back garden giving G...</p><br>

    <p>Breath in.Breath out.Please pay attention.What I am about to tell you is of paramount importance.I don’t have
      much time before she figures it out. I know what I am about to say may be confusing, but
      if you listen carefully, you will make the right decision.A patter of footsteps on tile down a hallway. The world
      won’t be what you think it will be in the future.You see, I’m...</p><br>

    <h3>“The Truth About Ghosts” by Thom Brodkin</h3><br><br>
    <p>Lenny didn’t know how old he was. I mean, he knew how old he was when he died—eighteen—but he wasn’t sure just
      how long he had been dead. That’s one of the first things you should know about ghosts. They have no concept of
      time. I mean, they see the sunrise and sunset, and if it’s necessary, they can still read clocks. But to a ghost,
      each day is pretty much like the one that came before it and identical to the one yet to come. It’s why they love
      dogs so much, there’s more about that to come. But back to L...</p><br>
