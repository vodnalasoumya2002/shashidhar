    <h1>What is a Book?</h1>
    <img align="right" src="book1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p id="b">A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many
        pages
        (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term
        for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for
        extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a
        codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.</p><br><br>
    <h1>Fantasy</h1>
    <img align="right" src="book2.avif" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p id="f">Fantasy books are probably the most popular modern book genre. Thanks to series like Harry Potter and
        Percy
        Jackson, it’s particularly popular with young adult readers, although more and more fantasy novels are written
        for adults (George RR Martin, we’re looking at you). These stories take readers on a journey beyond the known
        world, to places conjured in the author’s imagination.

    <h1>Comic</h1>
    <img align="right" src="book4.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p>A comic book, also called comicbook,[1][2] comic magazine or (in the United Kingdom and Ireland) simply comic, is
        a publication that consists of comics art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual
        scenes. Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative, usually, dialogue contained in
        word balloons emblematic of the comics art form.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Horror</h1>
    <img align="right" src="book3.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p id="h">People never tire of being terrified — so horror novels remain some of the bestselling books in the world.
        While
        the genre has origins in Gothic stories like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, authors like Stephen King and R L
        Stine have modernised horror for adults and children alike. The genre has also spawned hundreds of popular
        horror movies.

    <h1>Thriller</h1>
    <img align="right" src="book4.jfif" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p id="th">Thrillers are your typical page-turner. Full of action and suspense, thrillers can also often cross
        genres,
        particularly with crime and mystery. John Grisham, Stieg Larsson, and Gillian Flynn are some of the most popular
        thriller authors writing today, with Flynn’s Gone Girl among the top three bestselling books in the genre.
