    <h1 style="color: darkblue; font-size: 50px; font-style: bold;">What is the Story of Ayyappa?</h1>
    <p style="color:goldenrod; font-size: 20px; font-style: oblique; border: double 5px purple; margin-right: 500px;">It is generally believed that Lord Ayyappa was born to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva when Vishnu acquired the form
        of Mohini to lure the asura Bhasmasura. The asura had been bestowed with the boon that he could burn anything
        and everything. When he tried to burn Shiva, the deity asked Lord Vishnu to help him.</p>
