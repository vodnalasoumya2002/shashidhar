        <h2>“Sunbleached” by Nathan Ballingrud</h2><br><br>
        <p>One of the best stories in Ballingrud’s debut collection from Small Beer Press, North American Lake Monsters,
            “Sunbleached” was nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award in 2011. It’s one of my all-time favorite vampire
            stories, about a young boy in a broken family on the gulf coast who makes a deal with an injured vampire.
        </p><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>“How to Get Back to the Forest” by Sofia Samatar</h2><br><br>
        <p>Samatar is best-known for her fantasy novels A Stranger in Olondria and its follow-up The Winged Histories,
            but she can also flex her horror muscles when the mood strikes. When a short story begins with this line of
            dialogue—”You have to puke it up.”—you know you’re in for something creepy and weird. “How to Get Back to
            the Forest” also appeared in Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2015, edited by Joe Hill and John
            Joseph Adams.</p><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>“The Wilds” by Julia Elliott</h2><br><br>
        <p>The title story from Elliott’s 2014 collection is a perfect introduction to her singular brand of
            speculative, neo-Southern Gothic fiction. When a new family moves into the neighborhood, a young girl on the
            brink of womanhood is intrigued by a boy who wears a wolf mask.</p><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>“A Collapse of Horses” by Brian Evenson</h2><br><br>
        <p>The title track from Evenson’s latest collection is one of his most brutal explorations of the human
            condition. After a traumatic head injury, a man’s house (and family) keeps changing overnight. One day, he
            has three children. The next, he has four. To make matters worse, he comes across a paddock of horses that
            he can’t comprehend.</p><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>“Hello, Moto” by Nnedi Okorafor</h2><br><br>
        <p>Like Samatar, Okorafor has made a name for herself in a different genre—this time, science fiction, thanks to
            Lagoon and The Book of Phoenix—but her work actually spans the entire spectrum of speculative fiction. From
            the fantasy of Who Fears Death to the galactic horror of Binti, she refuses to be pigeonholed. “Hello, Moto”
            is a different kind of witch story, about power-conferring wigs. Yes…wigs.</p><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>“The Third Bear” by Jeff VanderMeer</h2><br><br>
        <p>The author of the Southern Reach trilogy, City of Saints and Madmen, and Finch is also a prolific short story
            writer, including this gem that was nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award in 2007. It’s also the title story
            from his 2010 collection by Tachyon Publications. He must really like bears, given the appearance of a giant
            one in his next novel from FSG, Borne.</p><br><br><br><br>
